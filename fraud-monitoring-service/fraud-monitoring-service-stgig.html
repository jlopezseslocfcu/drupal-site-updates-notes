<h1>Fraud Monitoring Service<a name="top"></a></h1>

<h2>Alerts now available via Text Message or Phone Call</h2>

<p>Our <strong>Fraud Detection and Notification System</strong> continually monitors the accounts of our Business and Consumer Visa cardholders to watch for suspicious debit, credit or ATM card activity, and notifies you if fraudulent activity is suspected. Our automated assistant, "Jill," works with a team of people to speed the notification process.</p>

<p>Effective July 1, 2020, all cardholders with a mobile phone number will be automatically enrolled in our free program to receive <strong>complimentary fraud alerts via text message.*</strong> If you do not have a mobile phone number in our records, you will receive a phone call. You may add or&nbsp;update your mobile phone number in Online Banking, via our <a href="https://www.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=5cb51be3-7af0-429c-a1f4-cec906eec1e7&amp;env=na1&amp;acct=3756b55d-8c07-482c-b379-9ec931a0b549&amp;activateonly=1">secure online form</a>, or you may call us at (805) 543-1816.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Here's how it works:</h2>

<h3><a name="notify"></a>If Fraud is Suspected</h3>

<ul class="diamond-list">
    <li>Our state-of-the art automated assistant, nick-named "Jill," (or one of her human counterparts) sends a text message to your primary mobile phone number. If you do not reply to the text message within five minutes, you will receive a phone call. If you do not have a mobile phone number in our records, you will receive a telephone call to&nbsp;your primary phone number.
        <ul>
            <li>â€‹<strong>Via text message: </strong>You will not be asked to verify your identity.&nbsp;You may also opt-out at this time from receiving future fraud alerts via text message.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Via phone call:</strong> You will be asked to verify your identity by entering the last four digits of the primary member's Social Security number (see "Security Identification" below) and birth date.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You will be asked to verify your recent card activity:&nbsp;
        <ul>
            <li>If you identify a transaction as fraud, your call is transferred to our Card Member Security Support Team to help you take the next steps to protect your card and your accounts.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If you verify the transaction is legitimate, you will be able to close the case with the automated assistant over the phone.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="security"></a>Security Identification</h3>

<p>The four digit segment of the primary account holder's Social Security number plus birth date are the only identifiers available to the monitoring service. This is enough to verify your identity, but not enough to compromise your personal security.&nbsp;You will&nbsp;<strong>NOT be asked to provide your account number, password, or other confidential information.</strong></p>

<h3><a name="precautions"></a>Safety Precautions</h3>

<p>If you receive a fraud alert and feel uncertain about the process or the identity of the sender, do not reply or hang up the phone and&nbsp;call SESLOC at (805) 543-1816. Or, you may call our&nbsp;Security Support Team&nbsp;direct at (888) 241-2440.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="blocking"></a>Protective Blocking</h3>

<p>If the Security Support Team is unable to verify the activity with you or with SESLOC, they use their experience and judgment to determine whether to place a protective block on your account. <strong>Your current phone number is essential for this process to succeed.&nbsp;</strong>You may add or&nbsp;update your mobile or home phone number in Online Banking, via our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=5cb51be3-7af0-429c-a1f4-cec906eec1e7&amp;env=na1&amp;acct=3756b55d-8c07-482c-b379-9ec931a0b549&amp;activateonly=1">secure online form</a>, or you may call us at (805) 543-1816.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="blocking"></a>Opt-Out</h3>

<p>You may opt-out of the text message alerts or the entire Fraud Detection and Notification program by calling (805) 543-1816. We strongly advise you to continue using this program to prevent fraud.&nbsp;</p>
