### After publishing page please ensure the following are met:
* ADA standards are met (alt tags, newer findings from recent audits, etc.)
* Absolute or relative links are set correctly
* PDFs and images that are no longer linked are also removed from the FTP (Or host?) and hidden from search. Travis and I will let you know when we have unlinked a PDF that should be sunset from search. This is usually only critical docs like fee schedules and disclosures, and images with price point information.
* Meta descriptions and url settings are also published. I am updating page titles, some descriptions, and the header image tag (so it shares on social nicely) on most pages as we go along.
* Main and Sidebar Menu has been updated on mobile and desktop, if needed.
* Page is copied to relevant environments and logged as such in Git.
